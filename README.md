## Features

- You can give a title to a timestamp
- It will display the title you had given and the time that the button was pressed

This project still in an early development, please be patience about UI errors :)

Things i plan to add in the near future:
>1 - checks if the title name arealdy exist and adds a number after, for example: 'title 1' 'title 2'
2 - Add a light and dark mode (dark - purple and black) (light - orange and white)
3 - Fix the grid system
4 - Fix the scrollframes
5 - give the UI a modern and professional look
