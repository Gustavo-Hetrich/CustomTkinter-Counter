# Counter
A counter made with python and Tkinter

Things i plan to add in the near future:

1 - checks if the title name arealdy exist and adds a number after, for example: 'title 1' 'title 2'

2 - Add a light and dark mode (dark - purple and black) (light - orange and white)

3 - Fix the grid system

4 - Fix the scrollframes

5 - give the UI a modern and professional look

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
